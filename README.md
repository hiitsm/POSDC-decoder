So this project is a Point of Sale Data Code decoder. 
Essentially when you make a transaction your bank/merchant gets a code tellinng them when the transaction was done, how it was done, through what means etc. and this program was just made to help ease the decoding process and to make it faster/ easier for anyone to understand the information. 

There's 2 "windows" to this. 
  -The main one is just for anyone to use and decode and it provides just that
  -The admin window allows for the deletion/ creation of users and just an overview and ability to change passwords but it requires specific logins to access
